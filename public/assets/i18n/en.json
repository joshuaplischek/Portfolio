I genuinely enjoy watching an idea turn into reality step by step: it starts with a concept, followed by countless lines of code – along with challenges that I tackle with full motivation. What fascinates me most about frontend development is being able to instantly see the effects of my code and experience the entire creation process firsthand. The diversity of programming languages excites me, and I love constantly learning new things.<br /> HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Angular form the foundation of my skillset. But I'm also very interested in languages like Java and Python – I'm always ready to expand my knowledge and work with them in the future. <br /><br /> I'm ready for the challenge of creating something exceptional – and making it a reality.",
